            <p class="storyText" id="story">You are Captain [Name], a seasoned explorer and captain of your own
                spaceship. Your
                latest mission has
                brought you to the desolate desert planet of Xirra, where you've picked up a distress signal from a
                remote settlement. As you approach the planet, you see the wreckage of a ship on the surface below. What
                will you do, Captain [Name]? The fate of Xirra and your own journey rests in your hands.</p>
            <p class="storyText" id="investigateStory">
                As you land your ship near the wreckage you hear a loud crunching sound and your ship shudders. The
                landing gear has been damaged, and you won't be able to take off until it's fixed. 
            </p>
            <p class="storyText" id="flyStory">You bypass the shipwreck and fly directly to the settlement where the
                distress signal originated from. However, your ship's systems detect an incoming sandstorm in that
                direction, which could damage your ship and make it difficult to navigate. You'll need to be careful and
                make a decision quickly if you want to reach the settlement before the storm hits.</p>
            <p class="storyText" id="monitorStory">
                You stay in orbit and monitor the situation from a safe distance. As you observe the wreckage, you
                can tell that there's nothing of value left. It's just a pile of twisted metal and debris. However, you
                notice a small settlement in the distance. It's located in a remote part of the planet's desert, but
                it's the only sign of life you've seen so far. You decide to fly directly to the settlement where the
                distress signal originated from.
            </p>
            <p class="storyText" id="exploreWreckageStory">As you rummage through the wreckage, you notice a few things
                of interest: a first aid kit, a toolbox, and a portable generator. However, your search is suddenly
                interrupted by the sound of growling coming from nearby. You turn to see a massive sand creature
                approaching, and you realize you need to act fast. You only have time to grab one of the items before
                retreating back to your ship. What will you choose to take with you?
            </p>
            <P class="storyText" id="theFootJourneyToSettlementStory">The journey to the settlement is treacherous and
                unforgiving. The scorching sun beats down on you relentlessly, and the endless dunes make the going slow
                and exhausting. Your water supply is running low, and you're starting to feel the effects of
                dehydration. add to this prompt where you encounter a person
                As you trudge through the endless desert, you catch a glimpse of movement in the distance. As you get
                closer, you see that it's a person, stumbling and swaying as they make their way across the dunes. They
                look disoriented and dehydrated, much like you feel. Do you approach them and offer assistance, or do
                you continue on your journey to the settlement, knowing that every minute counts? The decision is yours
                to make. </P>

            <P class="storyText" id="theFootJourneyToMountainStory">As you make your way towards the mountains, you
                notice the terrain getting rougher and more difficult to navigate. The sand gives way to rocks and the
                occasional patch of sparse vegetation. Suddenly, you hear a strange noise that sounds like a mix between
                a roar and a screech. You stop in your tracks and scan the surroundings, and soon enough, you spot the
                source of the sound: a massive creature with thick fur, sharp claws, and glowing eyes. It's like nothing
                you've ever seen before, but one thing is certain - it's not friendly. The creature starts charging at
                you, and you realize you'll need to act fast if you want to survive this encounter.</P>
            <p class="storyText" id="theCrashStory">As you push your ship to its limits, flying through the sandstorm,
                you start to lose control. The winds are too strong, and the sand is battering the hull of your ship.
                Suddenly, you hear a loud crash, and everything goes black.

                When you come to, you realize that your ship has crashed. The hull is severely damaged, and most of your
                supplies have been destroyed. You're lucky to be alive, but now you're stranded on this strange planet
                with no way to contact anyone for help. Time to make your way to the town on foot.</p>
                <p class="storyText" id="theTravlerStory"> you approach the traveler, they turn to face you and smile, relieved to see another person in this harsh environment. They introduce themselves as Ali and explain that they're a trader, traveling between settlements to sell goods and supplies. Ali offers to sell you some much-needed water and supplies to help you on your journey, but warns that the prices are steep out here in the desert.</p>
                <p class="storyText" id="theTravlerBarterStory">
                    You try to negotiate the price, and after some haggling, he agrees to sell you the food and for a mere 50 credits. You hand over the credits, and Ali hands you the supplies. You feel relieved and grateful to have found some sustenance in this unforgiving desert.
                    
                    With 450 Credits left you push on, your eyes fixed on the distant horizon where the settlement lies. After what seems like an eternity, you finally crest a dune and see the glimmering towers of the settlement in the distance. You quicken your pace, feeling a surge of hope and relief at the sight. The town is within reach, but you'll need to be cautious - who knows what dangers might lurk in this unforgiving environment.

                <p class="storyText" id="theTravlerTradeStory">
                    You accept the price as is, and you agree to buy the food and water for a 200 credits. You hand over the credits, and Ali hands you the supplies. You feel relieved and grateful to have found some sustenance in this unforgiving desert.

                    With only 300 Credits left you push on, your eyes fixed on the distant horizon where the settlement lies. After what seems like an eternity, you finally crest a dune and see the glimmering towers of the settlement in the distance. You quicken your pace, feeling a surge of hope and relief at the sight. The town is within reach, but you'll need to be cautious - who knows what dangers might lurk in this unforgiving environment.

                        avoid the incoming sandstorm. The journey is rough, and you have to navigate through narrow
                        passages, dodging sharp rocks and boulders. Suddenly, you misjudge a turn and crash into the
                        canyon wall, damaging your ship and injuring yourself in the process. Despite the setback, you
                        manage to continue on your journey, but you'll need to be more careful if you want to reach the
