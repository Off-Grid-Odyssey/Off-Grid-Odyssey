                You are Captain [Name], a seasoned explorer and captain of your own spaceship. Your latest mission has brought you to the desolate desert planet of Xirra, where you've picked up a distress signal from a remote settlement. As you approach the planet, you see the wreckage of a ship on the surface below. What will you do, Captain [Name]? The fate of Xirra and your own journey rests in your hands.</p>
            <p class="storyText" id="investigateStory"><!-- investigate -->
                As you land your ship near the wreckage you hear a loud crunching sound and your ship shudders. The
                landing gear has been damaged, and you won't be able to take off until it's fixed. 
            </p>
            <p class="storyText" id="flyStory"><!-- fly -->
                You bypass the shipwreck and fly directly to the settlement where the distress signal originated from. However, your ship's systems detect an incoming sandstorm in that direction, which could damage your ship and make it difficult to navigate. You'll need to be careful and make a decision quickly if you want to reach the settlement before the storm hits.</p>
            <p class="storyText" id="monitorStory"><!-- monitor -->
                You stay in orbit and monitor the situation from a safe distance. As you observe the wreckage, you
                can tell that there's nothing of value left. It's just a pile of twisted metal and debris. However, you
                notice a small settlement in the distance. It's located in a remote part of the planet's desert, but
                it's the only sign of life you've seen so far. You decide to fly directly to the settlement where the
                distress signal originated from.
            </p>
            <p class="storyText" id="exploreWreckageStory"><!-- wreckage -->
                As you rummage through the wreckage, you notice a few things
                of interest: a first aid kit, a toolbox, and a portable generator. However, your search is suddenly
                interrupted by the sound of growling coming from nearby. You turn to see a massive sand creature
                approaching, and you realize you need to act fast. You only have time to grab one of the items before
                retreating back to your ship. What will you choose to take with you?

                The journey to the settlement is treacherous and
                unforgiving. The scorching sun beats down on you relentlessly, and the endless dunes make the going slow
                and exhausting. Your water supply is running low, and you're starting to feel the effects of
                dehydration. add to this prompt where you encounter a person
                As you trudge through the endless desert, you catch a glimpse of movement in the distance. As you get
                closer, you see that it's a person, stumbling and swaying as they make their way across the dunes. They
                look disoriented and dehydrated, much like you feel. Do you approach them and offer assistance, or do
                you continue on your journey to the settlement, knowing that every minute counts? The decision is yours
                to make. </P>

                As you make your way towards the mountains, you
                notice the terrain getting rougher and more difficult to navigate. The sand gives way to rocks and the
                occasional patch of sparse vegetation. Suddenly, you hear a strange noise that sounds like a mix between
                a roar and a screech. You stop in your tracks and scan the surroundings, and soon enough, you spot the
                source of the sound: a massive creature with thick fur, sharp claws, and glowing eyes. It's like nothing
                you've ever seen before, but one thing is certain - it's not friendly. The creature starts charging at
                you, and you realize you'll need to act fast if you want to survive this encounter.</P>
            <P class="storyText" id="MountainStoryTwo"><!-- this story goes from town IF your choices led to ship confiscation. -->
                The settlement has walls all around with sentries, so they decided it would be okay to give your crew plasma pistols before forcing you out of their main gate. As you make your way towards the mountains, you notice the terrain getting rougher and more difficult to navigate. The sand gives way to rocks and the occasional patch of sparse vegetation.

            <P class="storyText" id="MountainStoryTwoShootAtCreatureFace">
                Your crew quickly raises their plasma pistols and takes aim at the charging creature's face. They fire several shots, and some hit their mark, but the creature keeps coming. It seems almost unfazed by the plasma bolts and gets closer and closer. Suddenly, one of your crew members misses their shot, and the creature swipes at them with its massive paw. The crew member is thrown back and hits the ground hard. The creature now has its attention on the downed crew member, giving the rest of your crew a chance to fire more shots at its face. The creature staggers back, roaring in pain, but it isn't dead yet. It starts to charge again, this time at the crew still shooting. You realize that you'll need to come up with a new plan fast.
            </P>
            <P class="storyText" id="MountainStoryTwoShootAtCreatureTorso">
                You quickly analyze the charging creature and determine that shooting at its torso would be the best course of action. You command your crew to aim at the creature's midsection and fire. They follow your orders, and their shots hit their mark with perfect accuracy. The creature roars in pain and slows down, but it's still coming at you. Your crew fires another round of shots, and the creature finally falls to the ground, motionless. You breathe a sigh of relief and congratulate your crew on a job well done.
            </P>
            <P class="storyText" id="MountainStoryTwoRunAway">
                You quickly realize that the creature is too powerful for your crew to handle, so you command them to split in half and run in opposite directions. The creature charges at your crew, but it can't decide which group to go after. It roars in frustration and confusion, giving your crew enough time to make their escape. You run as fast as you can, but you can still hear the creature's roars in the distance. You don't know if it's still following you, but you keep running until you're out of breath. You stop to catch your breath and scan your surroundings, but you don't see the creature anywhere. You realize that you've managed to evade the creature and thank your lucky stars for making it out alive.

                As you push your ship to its limits, flying through the sandstorm,
                you start to lose control. The winds are too strong, and the sand is battering the hull of your ship.
                Suddenly, you hear a loud crash, and everything goes black.

                When you come to, you realize that your ship has crashed. The hull is severely damaged, and most of your
                supplies have been destroyed. You're lucky to be alive, but now you're stranded on this strange planet
                with no way to contact anyone for help. Time to make your way to the town on foot.</p>
            <p class="storyText" id="theTravlerStory"><!-- if you choose to approach the traveler -->
                You approach the traveler, they turn to face you and smile, relieved to see another person in this harsh environment. They introduce themselves as Ali and explain that they're a trader, traveling between settlements to sell goods and supplies. Ali offers to sell you some much-needed water and supplies to help you on your journey, but warns that the prices are steep out here in the desert.</p>

                You try to negotiate the price, and after some haggling, he agrees to sell you the food and for a mere 50 credits. You hand over the credits, and Ali hands you the supplies. You feel relieved and grateful to have found some sustenance in this unforgiving desert.
                    
                With 450 Credits left you push on, your eyes fixed on the distant horizon where the settlement lies. After what seems like an eternity, you finally crest a dune and see the glimmering towers of the settlement in the distance. You quicken your pace, feeling a surge of hope and relief at the sight. The town is within reach, but you'll need to be cautious - who knows what dangers might lurk in this unforgiving environment.

            <p class="storyText" id="theTravlerTradeStory"><!-- choose to trade -->
                You accept the price as is, and you agree to buy the food and water for a 200 credits. You hand over the credits, and Ali hands you the supplies. You feel relieved and grateful to have found some sustenance in this unforgiving desert.

                With only 300 Credits left you push on, your eyes fixed on the distant horizon where the settlement lies. After what seems like an eternity, you finally crest a dune and see the glimmering towers of the settlement in the distance. You quicken your pace, feeling a surge of hope and relief at the sight.

                As you approach the settlement, you notice that there are several individuals moving around and working on various tasks. You land your ship and step out to introduce yourself to the settlers.

                At first, they seem friendly and welcoming, eager to learn more about your travels and your ship. However, as you begin to converse with them, you realize that they are becoming increasingly interested in your ship and its capabilities.

                The settlers explain that their settlement is located on a resource-poor planet and they are constantly struggling to meet their basic needs. They have been attempting to repair an old spacecraft for years, but they lack the knowledge and resources to get it fully operational.

                They see your ship as a potential solution to their problems and begin to pressure you to sell or trade it to them. Despite your reluctance, the settlers become increasingly aggressive and make it clear that they will do whatever it takes to obtain your ship.

                They soon realize you aren't willing to part with your ship and decide to confiscate it. They give you a miserable offering of 1,500 credits and begin to lead you further into the settlement. 

                You are vastly outnumbered, and despite the settlers not owning a functioning spacecraft... They are very well armed with old, but clearly well cared for plasma rifles.
