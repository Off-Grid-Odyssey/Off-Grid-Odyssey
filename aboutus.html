            <p>My name is Ryan Gosselin and I currently reside in Texas. I am a student at Code Fellows, on the Java and Android app development path. My dream is to be able to influence the global UI/UX experience. I want to make the human-computer interactions of the future, better. We have been using a mouse and keyboard long enough. Whether I affect this through app and software development, or software development for interfacing with devices, I just want to be involved in advancements in peripheral devices. My wife and I love to travel together, along with our dog, Momo(she is named after the lemur in Avatar: The Last Airbender). My wife has a work from home job in Finance. I worked in IT, in various forms for almost 10 years before deciding to transition to software development. Our goal is to be able to both be home for our jobs and split our time between America and southern Turkiye near the Mediterranean sea.</p>
