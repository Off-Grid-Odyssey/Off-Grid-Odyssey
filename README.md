explorer and captain of your own spaceship, you'll travel to one alien planet,  with its own unique
challenges and dangers. Explore desolate deserts, lush forests, and frozen wastelands, uncovering the secrets of a
long-lost civilization along the way. But be warned: every decision you make could mean the difference between
success and failure. Choose wisely, and you just might save the galaxy from catastrophe. Choose poorly, and you
 may never make it home. Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime?
